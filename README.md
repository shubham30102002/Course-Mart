Hello, this is Bing. I can help you write a more detailed description for your GitHub README file. Here is a possible example:

# My Online Courses Website

This is a personal project that I created to demonstrate my skills and interests in frontend web development. It is a responsive and user-friendly website that displays 50+ online courses across five categories: AI, web development, software engineering, data science, and design.

## Features

- The website uses React.js, HTML, and Tailwind CSS to create a modern and interactive user interface.
- The website fetches and displays courses data from a RESTful API using Axios and React hooks. Each course has a title, an image, a description, a price, and a rating.
- The website has a navbar with dropdown menus and icons that allow the user to view courses by category, price, rating, or popularity.
- The website also has a feature that lets the user like and unlike courses using React state and localstorage. The liked courses are stored in the browser and can be accessed from the navbar.
- The website generates toast notifications based on user actions using React Toastify. For example, when the user likes or unlikes a course, a toast message will appear on the screen.

## Installation and Usage

To run this project locally, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/shubham30102002/Top-Courses.git`
- Go to the project directory: `cd my-online-courses-website`
- Install the dependencies: `npm install`
- Start the development server: `npm start`
- Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
